# Videopiano
Videopiano is a playful animated piano installation that makes it easy to start playing music without any musical knowledge. Videopiano could be used as a museum exhibit, musical presentation or just a game. Home use is also possible as the hardware is not expensive. Old piano collecting dust? Get Videopiano!
